## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

# Fisiosys 💪

## Description

    Fisiosys is a system for big centres with multiple phisiotherapists, the idea for fisiosys is to be a manager for each user in the centre. But also give them a web page.
    In the administrator the will be able to create clients, appointments and also a history for each client where they will be adding cases like what was the first way the client get there.


## Connection and DB

    The system uses astro db, a drizzle based database. And will be remotely connected to astro studio.

## Fisiosys as a product

    Fisiosys will be hosted in fisiosys.com a domain bought by RGG. We arent sure if it will use the sneat product design.

## Zero to build

    - Clone the repo
    - Connect to astro studio. Link to a new or existing project & push your local db config to the remote db
    ```ts
    npx astro login
    npx astro link
    npx astro db push
    ```
    - npx astro build --remote
